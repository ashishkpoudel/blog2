      <p>I really like productivity tools. I want to develop software faster, I want to work less, I want to release software fast.  Unfortunately, there is a mindset that cares only for (initial) speed and productivity at the expense of everything else. Those developers rush to finish fast and are very proud of it. They’ll code in 2 days, what you code in 5. Sure, they don’t have tests, the ‘architecture’ is at most MVC and the software ‘just works’ (well, you know… bugs but what software is perfect anyway?) Changes mean patching/hacking things together and it’s all natural that everything will become a complicated mess, it’s software development, it’s expected to be hard and complicated (really?!).</p>
      <p>But nevertheless, they ‘ship’ the first version so fast, they’re that good. Too bad that a software product is finished only when it’s at the end of life. Finished software is dead software (found that bit on twitter) and I wholly agree with it.</p>
